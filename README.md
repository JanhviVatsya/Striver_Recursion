ðŸŒ€ Recursion Notes
This repository contains my personal notes and solutions on Recursion, prepared while practicing from Striverâ€™s A2Z DSA Sheet.
The notes are structured for easy revision, with key concepts, patterns, and solved problems for better understanding.

ðŸ“Œ Reference â€“ Striverâ€™s A2Z DSA Sheet
All questions are mapped from the Recursion section of Striverâ€™s A2Z DSA Sheet.

ðŸŽ¯ Why These Notes?
To revise recursion quickly before interviews and contests
To build intuition by understanding how recursion breaks problems down
To keep a structured collection of solved problems linked to Striverâ€™s A2Z roadmap

âœ¨ These notes are for learning + revision. If youâ€™re also following Striverâ€™s A2Z Sheet, this will serve as a handy companion!
